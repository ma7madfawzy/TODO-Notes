# News App 🗞

News App is a simple news app 🗞️ which uses [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch top news headlines from the API. The main aim of this app is to be a leading example of how to build Modern Android applications for all Android Developers

The codebase focuses 👓 on following key things:
- Code structuring, style and comments 🗡
- Kotlin + Coroutines 🛠
- Dependency injection 🗡
- MVVM 
- Pagination
- User Interface

The idea is to keep the app super simple while demonstrating new libraries and tools which makes it easier to build high quality Android applications.

## Libraries and tools 🛠

News App uses libraries and tools used to build Modern Android application, mainly part of Android Jetpack 🚀

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) first
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) and [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) first
- [Architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture)
- [Dagger 2](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) for dependency injection 🗡- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- [Picasso](https://square.github.io/picasso/)
- [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/picasso/)
- [Gson](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)
- [Material Design](https://material.io/design) for user interface
- [sdp](https://github.com/intuit/ssp) for multi screen dimensions
- Other [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) components


## Architecture

The app uses MVVM [Model-View-ViewModel] architecture to have a unidirectional flow of data, separation of concern, testability, and a lot more.
